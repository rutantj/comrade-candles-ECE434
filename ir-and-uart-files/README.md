# ir-and-uart-files
This folder contains all of the UART and IR modules and examples that we worked on
but inevitably cut from the project due to time and development issues. 

uartExample.py in /uart can print UART signals from the IR receiver to the terminal.
We had issues with implementing a way of processing the signals reliably and did not have enough
time to work on the IR remote capability that we planned to have originally.
